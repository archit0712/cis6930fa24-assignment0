His last communication with family members was in early April 1978 when he called an aunt, stating he was working on a shipping dock (possibly on the SS President riverboat) in New Orleans, Louisiana. Prior to his disappearance, he sent a postcard to his aunt from New Orleans saying he was doing fine. He has never been heard from again.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>Doran was known to hitchhike, traveling across the country from California to Florida. He was a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, an avid guitar player, and liked to write short stories and poetry. He also carried a small pocket Bible with him. Fingerprints are available for comparison, and DNA from family members is in CODIS.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "subjects": ["ViCAP Missing Persons"], "eyes": "blue", "publication": "2021-06-24T08:53:00", "complexion": null, "possible_countries": null, "race_raw": "White", "person_classification": "Main", "dates_of_birth_used": null, "url": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/vicap/missing-persons/randy-stewart-doran---new-orleans-louisiana", "warning_message": null, "reward_text": null, "age_max": 22, "field_offices": null, "height_min": 71, "weight_min": 160, "additional_information": null, "weight_max": 160, "build": null, "height_max": 71, "occupations": null, "nationality": null, "reward_max": 0, "poster_classification": "default", "scars_and_marks": "Doran has a scar on his upper lip.
